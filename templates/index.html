        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Building a Basic NL2SQL Model</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-[20px] leading-[1.7777778rem]">
            The first step in our journey to revolutionize database querying with natural language is constructing a
            basic NL2SQL model using LangChain. This foundational model serves as the cornerstone for more advanced
            functionalities we'll explore later. Here's how we begin:
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Understanding the Basics</h3>
        <p class="mb-4 text-[20px] leading-[1.7777778rem]">
            At its core, an NL2SQL model aims to translate natural language queries into SQL commands. But how do we
            start building such a model with LangChain?
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Setting Up LangChain</h3>
        <p class="mb-4 text-[20px] leading-[1.7777778rem]">
            LangChain simplifies the process of creating NL2SQL models by providing a flexible framework that integrates
            seamlessly with existing databases and natural language processing (NLP) models. To get started, you'll need
            to:
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-[20px] leading-[1.7777778rem]"><strong>Install LangChain:</strong> Ensure that LangChain
            is installed in your environment.</p>
        <pre
            class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded mb-4 overflow-x-auto"><code>pip install langchain_openai langchain_community langchain pymysql chromadb -q</code></pre>
        <p class="mb-4 text-[20px] leading-[1.7777778rem]"><strong>Connect to Your Database:</strong> The next step
            involves establishing a connection to
            your database. LangChain supports various database systems, so you'll likely find your database among the
            supported ones. You'll use the database credentials to create a connection that LangChain can use to
            interact with your data.</p>
        <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded mb-4 overflow-x-auto">

import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""

db_user = ""

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">The First Query</h3>
        <p class="mb-4 text-[20px] leading-[1.7777778rem]">
            Once the setup is complete, the real magic begins. You can start by formulating a simple query in natural
            language, such as "Show me all products priced above $100." LangChain takes this input and, through its
            integration with language models like ChatGPT and your database, generates an SQL query that precisely
            captures the intent of your request.
        </p>

query = generate_query.invoke({"question": "what is price of `1968 Ford Mustang`"})
# "what is price of `1968 Ford Mustang`"

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Seeing the Results</h3>
        <p class="mb-4 text-[20px] leading-[1.7777778rem]">
            Executing the generated SQL query against your database retrieves the data you're looking for, which
            LangChain can then present in a user-friendly format.
        </p>
        <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded mb-4 overflow-x-auto">

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Moving Forward</h3>
        <p class="mb-4 text-[20px] leading-[1.7777778rem]">
            With the basic NL2SQL model set up, you've taken the first step towards transforming how we interact with
            databases. However, this is just the beginning. As we progress, we'll explore how to enhance the model's
            accuracy, handle more complex queries, and even maintain context over a conversation for follow-up
            questions.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Rephrasing Answers for Enhanced Clarity</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-[20px] leading-[1.7777778rem]">
            After your NL2SQL model successfully executes a SQL query, the next pivotal step is to present the data in a
            manner that's easily understandable by your users. This is where the art of rephrasing SQL results into
            clear, natural language answers comes into play. Here's how you can achieve this with LangChain:
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Implementing Rephrasing with LangChain</h3>
        <p class="mb-4 text-[20px] leading-[1.7777778rem]">
            <strong>Use Prompt Templates:</strong> LangChain allows you to create prompt templates that can guide the
            model in how to rephrase SQL results. These templates can include placeholders for the original question,
            the SQL query, and the query result, setting the stage for generating a natural language response.
        </p>
        <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded mb-4 overflow-x-auto">
<code>
from operator import itemgetter

from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough

answer_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    """Given the following user question, corresponding SQL query, and SQL result, answer the user question.

Question: {question}
SQL Query: {query}
SQL Result: {result}
Answer: """
)

rephrase_answer = answer_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()

chain = (
    RunnablePassthrough.assign(query=generate_query).assign(
        result=itemgetter("query") | execute_query
    )
    | rephrase_answer
)

chain.invoke({"question": "How many customers have an order count greater than 5"})
</code>
</pre>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Example: Transforming SQL Results into User-Friendly Responses</h3>
        <p class="mb-4 text-[20px] leading-[1.7777778rem]">
            Let's consider a user asks, "How many customers have an order count greater than 5?" and the SQL query
            returns a count of 42. Instead of presenting this raw data, LangChain helps you generate a polished response
            like, "There are 42 customers who have placed more than 5 orders." This transformation not only enhances
            clarity but also improves the overall user experience.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Incorporating Few-Shot Learning for Improved Accuracy</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-[20px] leading-[1.7777778rem]">
            As we progress in our NL2SQL journey, it's crucial to focus on enhancing the model's accuracy. One effective
            method is incorporating few-shot learning, where the model learns from a small number of example queries and
            their corresponding SQL translations. This section delves into how few-shot learning can be implemented with
            LangChain to improve your NL2SQL model's performance.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why Few-Shot Learning?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4 text-[20px] leading-[1.7777778rem]">
            Few-shot learning provides the model with context and examples, enabling it to better understand and
            generalize natural language queries. By providing just a handful of examples, you can significantly improve
            the model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries for similar questions.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Implementing Few-Shot Learning in LangChain</h3>
        <p class="mb-4 text-[20px] leading-[1.7777778rem]">
            To incorporate few-shot learning, you can use LangChain's capabilities to input example queries and their
            corresponding SQL translations. This helps the model recognize patterns and apply similar logic to new
            queries.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Example: Adding Examples to the Model</h3>
        <p class="mb-4 text-[20px] leading-[1.7777778rem]">
            Suppose you have example queries like "List all employees in the sales department" and "Show the total sales
            for the year 2023". By including these examples in your model setup, LangChain can learn the structure and
            context, thereby generating more accurate SQL queries for similar new questions.
        </p>
        <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded mb-4 overflow-x-auto">
            <code>
            # Example template and few-shot learning setup can be added here based on LangChain's documentation and capabilities
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p class="mb-4 text-[20px] leading-[1.7777778rem]">
            By leveraging few-shot learning, you enhance your NL2SQL model's ability to handle a wider range of queries
            with improved accuracy, ultimately making your database interactions more robust and reliable.
